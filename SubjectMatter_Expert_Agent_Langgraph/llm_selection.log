2025-03-14 10:11:18,538 - INFO - Question: What is Qubit and how superpositioning affects their working? classified as topic: this question would be classified as 'physics'. 

qubits (quantum bits) are a fundamental concept in quantum computing and are a key part of quantum physics. superpositioning is a property of quantum physics where a qubit can exist in multiple states simultaneously, which is a key difference from classical bits.

so, the correct classification is 'physics'.

2025-03-14 10:11:18,933 - INFO - Question: What is Qubit and how superpositioning affects their working? classified as difficulty: i would classify the difficulty level of this question as 'medium'. 

here's a breakdown of why: 

- the concept of a qubit is relatively advanced and requires some knowledge of quantum mechanics and computing.
- the question of how superpositioning affects the working of qubits requires some understanding of quantum principles, such as the ability of qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously.
- however, the question does not require in-depth mathematical derivations or highly specialized knowledge, which would make it more challenging. 

therefore, a 'medium' difficulty level is a fair assessment, assuming the respondent has some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and computing.
